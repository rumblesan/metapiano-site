# Meta Piano project site

This is the web facing site for the Meta Piano project. It will display information about the project, provide a link to the audio stream, and allow people to upload poems.

## Developing

If you want to develop the site, these instructions should help.

These instructions will hopefully not be very command line heavy.

### Windows

Make sure you have (Java)[http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp] and (SBT)[http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt//0.12.2/sbt.msi] installed.

It would also be a good idea to get the (Github for Windows)[http://windows.github.com/] app which should make git easier to use.
